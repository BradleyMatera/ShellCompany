## Detailed Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Directive Input & Analysis

**Board Room Directive Submission**
```javascript
// Example directive structure
{
  "id": "workflow_12345",
  "directive": "Create a professional landing page for Hornets youth football team",
  "priority": "high",
  "projectId": "project_abc123",
  "submittedBy": "board_room",
  "timestamp": "2024-09-16T13:30:00Z"
}
```

**Alex PM Analysis Process**
```mermaid

    participant BR as Board Room
    participant Alex as Alex (PM)
    participant WO as Workflow Orchestrator
    participant DB as Database
    
    BR->>Alex: Submit Directive
    Alex->>Alex: Analyze Requirements
    Alex->>Alex: Identify Skills Needed
    Alex->>Alex: Estimate Complexity
    Alex->>WO: Create Workflow Plan
    WO->>DB: Persist Workflow
    Alex->>BR: Confirm Analysis Complete
```

### Phase 2: Clarification & Requirements

**Clarification Request Flow**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Ambiguous Directive] --> B[Alex Identifies Gaps]
    B --> C[Generate Clarification Questions]
    C --> D[Send to Board Room]
    D --> E[Await Response]
    E --> F[Process Response]
    F --> G{Sufficient Detail?}
    G -->|No| C
    G -->|Yes| H[Proceed to Task Decomposition]
```

**Example Clarification Questions**
- Target audience demographics and preferences
- Required functionality and features
- Design style and branding requirements
- Timeline and delivery expectations
- Integration requirements with existing systems

### Phase 3: Task Decomposition & Agent Assignment

**Intelligent Task Breakdown**
```javascript
// Example task decomposition for landing page
{
  "workflowId": "workflow_12345",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "task_001",
      "assignedAgent": "Pixel",
      "description": "Design visual identity and mockups for Hornets team",
      "estimatedDuration": 180000,
      "dependencies": [],
      "priority": "high"
    },
    {
      "id": "task_002", 
      "assignedAgent": "Nova",
      "description": "Build responsive HTML structure",
      "estimatedDuration": 240000,
      "dependencies": ["task_001"],
      "priority": "high"
    },
    {
      "id": "task_003",
      "assignedAgent": "Nova",
      "description": "Implement interactive features and animations",
      "estimatedDuration": 180000,
      "dependencies": ["task_002"],
      "priority": "medium"
    },
    {
      "id": "task_004",
      "assignedAgent": "Cipher",
      "description": "Security review and optimization",
      "estimatedDuration": 120000,
      "dependencies": ["task_003"],
      "priority": "medium"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Agent Selection Algorithm**

    C --> D[Workload Balancing]
    D --> E[Specialization Priority]
    E --> F[Final Assignment]
    
    subgraph "Selection Criteria"
        G[Technical Skills]
        H[Domain Expertise]
        I[Current Capacity]
        J[Historical Performance]
    end
    
    B --> G
    B --> H
    C --> I
    E --> J
```

### Phase 4: Parallel Execution & Coordination

**Real-time Execution Monitoring**
```mermaid

    title Workflow Execution Timeline
    dateFormat  HH:mm
    axisFormat  %H:%M
    
    section Design Phase
    Visual Identity Design    :active, design1, 13:30, 16:30
    
    section Development Phase  
    HTML Structure           :dev1, after design1, 3h
    Interactive Features     :dev2, after dev1, 2h
    
    section Quality Phase

    Integration Testing     :qa2, after qa1, 1h
    
    section Review Phase
    Manager Review          :rev1, after qa2, 30m
    CEO Approval           :rev2, after rev1, 30m
```

**Agent Communication Patterns**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alex as Alex (PM)
    participant Pixel as Pixel (Designer)
    participant Nova as Nova (Frontend)
    participant Cipher as Cipher (Security)
    participant WO as Workflow Orchestrator
    
    Alex->>Pixel: Assign design task
    Pixel->>Pixel: Create visual identity
    Pixel->>Nova: Share design assets
    Pixel->>Alex: Report design complete
    
    Alex->>Nova: Assign frontend task
    Nova->>Nova: Build HTML structure
    Nova->>Cipher: Request security review
    Nova->>Alex: Report frontend progress
    
    Alex->>Cipher: Assign security review
    Cipher->>Cipher: Security analysis
    Cipher->>Nova: Security recommendations
    Cipher->>Alex: Report security complete
    
    Alex->>WO: Update workflow status
```

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance & Testing

**Multi-layered Quality Review**
```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Task Completion] --> B[Self-Review]
    B --> C[Peer Review]
    C --> D[Integration Testing]
    D --> E[Performance Testing]
    E --> F[Security Validation]
    F --> G[Quality Gate Decision]
    G -->|Pass| H[Advance to Manager Review]
    G -->|Fail| I[Return for Rework]
    I --> A
```

**Quality Metrics**
- **Code Quality**: Syntax, best practices, maintainability
- **Performance**: Load times, responsiveness, optimization
- **Security**: Vulnerability scanning, compliance checks
- **Usability**: User experience, accessibility, mobile compatibility
- **Integration**: Compatibility with existing systems

### Phase 6: Approval Gating

**Three-tier Approval Process**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as Completing Agent
    participant Alex as Alex (Manager)
    participant CEO as CEO
    participant BR as Board Room
    
    Agent->>Alex: Submit completed work
    Alex->>Alex: Manager Review
    Alex->>Alex: Quality Assessment
    Alex-->Agent: Request changes (if needed)
    Alex->>CEO: Submit for CEO approval
    CEO->>CEO: Strategic Review
    CEO->>CEO: Final Quality Check
    CEO-->Alex: Request changes (if needed)
    CEO->>BR: Announce completion
    BR->>BR: Workflow marked complete
```

**Approval Criteria**

**Manager (Alex) Review:**
- Task completion against requirements
- Quality standards compliance
- Integration with overall project goals
- Resource utilization efficiency

**CEO Review:**
- Strategic alignment with company objectives
- Innovation and excellence standards
- Market readiness and competitiveness
- Long-term value and sustainability

### Phase 7: Completion & Artifact Management

    }
  ],
  "completionTime": "2024-09-16T19:00:00Z",
  "totalDuration": 19800000,
  "qualityScore": 94
}
```

## Workflow State Management

### State Transitions
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "Workflow States" as ws
    state ws {
        [*] --> planned
        planned --> awaiting_clarification : needs_clarification
        awaiting_clarification --> in_progress : clarification_received
        planned --> in_progress : requirements_clear
        in_progress --> executing : tasks_assigned
        executing --> waiting_for_review : all_tasks_complete
        waiting_for_review --> waiting_for_ceo_approval : manager_approved
        waiting_for_ceo_approval --> completed : ceo_approved
        waiting_for_ceo_approval --> executing : ceo_requests_changes
        waiting_for_review --> executing : manager_requests_changes
        executing --> failed : critical_error
        in_progress --> paused : temporary_hold
        paused --> executing : resume_workflow
    }
```

### Error Handling & Recovery

**Automatic Recovery Mechanisms**
- **Task Failure Recovery**: Automatic reassignment to alternative agents
- **Provider Failover**: Switch to backup AI providers on service interruption
- **State Persistence**: Complete workflow state saved every 30 seconds
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert to previous stable state

**Manual Intervention Points**
- **Clarification Requests**: Human input required for ambiguous requirements
- **Quality Gate Failures**: Manual review required for quality issues
- **Resource Conflicts**: Human decision required for priority conflicts
- **Strategic Changes**: CEO-level decisions for workflow modifications

## Performance Metrics & SLAs

### Workflow Performance Targets
- **Clarification Response Time**: < 1 hour during business hours
- **Task Assignment Time**: < 5 minutes from requirement finalization

- **Agent Utilization**: 85% optimal workload distribution

## Monitoring & Observability

### Real-time Dashboards
