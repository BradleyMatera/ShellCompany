## 🎯 Production Verification Checklist

### ✅ AI Provider Verification
```bash
# Test Engine Status (shows real provider data)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/engine/status?ping=true

# Test Model Discovery (shows live models from APIs)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/engine/models

# Test Provider Health (shows real latency/status)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/engine/test/openai \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Test"}'
```

### ✅ Workflow System Verification
```bash
# Check existing workflows (shows real execution data)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/autonomous/workflows

# View agent status (shows 37 real agents)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/agents

# Check worker processes (shows live infrastructure)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/workers
```

### ✅ Real-time Features
